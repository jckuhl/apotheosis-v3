        <h4>What is Apotheosis?</h4>
        <p>Apotheosis is a tool for authors to help them with the difficult task of world building.   Here you can create universes for your stories.  Within each universe, you may have multiple worlds, planets, characters, cities, nations, you name it.  Many templates have been provided for you to fill out, but you may also create your own templates as you wish.</p>
        <p>There are two primary tools on this site, the universe builder and the storyboarder.  The universe builder is for world building, while the storyboarder is to help you design your plot and outline your story and structure your scenes.  While they are separate tools, they do communicate with each other, allowing you to cross reference your material from one while working in the other.</p>
        <h4>Apotheosis On the Desktop</h4>
        <p>There is a version of Apotheosis that is available as a desktop app.  Click on the <mark>Desktop</mark> tab to find a download.  Apotheosis is supported on Windows, MacOS and Linux.</p>
        <h4>But what if I don't want my material online?</h4>
        <p>No worries.  Whether it's for privacy or mobility or whatever the reason, you can always work wholly offline.  You can upload and download your universes and their components as <code>.json</code> files.  Simply chose the <mark>Save As JSON</mark> file at the bottom of the page.  Furthermore, you can go to your profile in the <mark>Settings</mark> tab and click off the <mark>Online</mark> toggle to keep your data from being uploaded to the database.  Of course you don't have to be offline to use this feature.</p>
        <blockquote>
            But what is <code>.json</code>?  JSON is a data interchange format.  It saves your data in a text file as key value pairs.  If that still sounds like greek, don't worry, so long as the file ends in a .json extension, the website can parse it and display its information.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Once the <code>.json</code> is uploaded, the webpage will display it.</p>
        <h4>Something broke!</h4>
        <p>Oh no!  Please submit an issue <a href="https://github.com/jckuhl/apotheosis-v3/issues" target="_blank">here</a> describing your problem and it will be investigated.  Apotheosis is open source, the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/jckuhl/apotheosis-v3" target="_blank">Github</a>.  Contribution is welcome.</p>
